## The TWO Mental Shifts Highly Successful People Make


“When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.”— Max Planck,  Nobel Prize winner
There are two primary mental shifts that occur in the lives of all highly successful people. Many make the first, 
Both of these shifts require a great deal of mental stretching from conventional and societal ways of thinking. In many ways, these shifts require you to unlearn the negative and sabotaging programming from your youth, public education, and even adulthood.
The foundation of the first shift is the sublime power of choice and individual responsibility. Once a you make this shift, you are empowered to pull yourself from poverty of time, finances, and relationships. In other words, the first shift allows you to create a happy and prosperous life, where, for the most part, you control how and on what you invest your time.

## Shift 1: The Power of Choice and individual responsibility
The following are the core components of your mental model after you’ve experienced the first shift:
1.1 You are responsible
1.2 Every choice has a cost and consequence
“Free-will” doesn’t exist.We control our actions, but the consequences that flow from those actions are controlled by principles

1.3 Success (and happiness) is a choice
Success, health, and happiness are all consequences. They are by-products. They are effects, not causes.

You can’t control the effects; principles control these. However, you can control the causes of these things, which are your behaviors. Negative environmental factors? Change them

- confidence is a direct reflection of past performance.
1.4 Momentum is essential 
Finally, people who have experienced this first mental shift really care about momentum. They’ve worked hard to develop their momentum and know what it feels like to not have momentum.

Being without momentum is rough. It’s how most people live their lives. And without momentum, results are minimal, even with lots of effort.
Consistency is key to developing momentum. You get it by putting intentional effort toward a singular goal or vision, and eventually the compound effect takes over. It’s as though several outside sources are working for your good. Because, they are.

The habits Covey outlines to experience this private victory (First Shift) are:
- Be proactive
- Begin with the end in mind
- Put first things first
Once you master these habits, you will go from dependence on others to a high state of independence — the first mental shift
