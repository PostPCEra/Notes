## Market Size Estimation for Movie Ticket reservation

#### As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cinema_and_movie_theater_chains)

> According to their figures, the top 4 chains represent almost half of the theater screens in North America. NATO states that the number of U.S. movie screens as of December 2014 are 39,356 indoor screens on 5,463 sites and 656 Drive-In screens on 393 sites.

- so total 40,000 screens in USA  
- 40k x 25 avg. people per screen = 1 M  per show  
- 3 shows a day ->  3 Million People watching movies everyday 
- say 5% buying tickets online today that is 150k tickets bought per day
- 150k x 365 days =  $55 million dollars per year ( they charge $1 per ticket booking ) 
- if avg. people watching per screen is 50 , then annual income is doube that is $100 M
