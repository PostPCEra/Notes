3/ [Ape To Man: Evolution Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sMqFivWTmk) 
+ 3.2 Million ago, Ape Started WALKING Bi PIDEL, resulting in 
  + a) improved SURVIVAL as can see LONG distances ( which resulted in predicting the prey danger ahead and 'HIDE/Climb trees' accordingly ) 
  + b) HANDS are FREED, hence used to develop and use STONE TOOLS ( Tools further used for Survival and to protect from other animals, hence 'Darwin Natural Selection theory Kicked-in' )
  + These two characterstics/skills gave APE the "crucial early EDGE" over other Animals to dominate the "Animal kingdom" eventually.
  
+ Technology development paved the path way (This is why you need to know History which can help you see FUTURE )
  + from 1920 to 1970 Scients struggled where to dig for Fossils to examine Anicent human Fossils. Hundreds of Scients digged random places for Decades
  + then came Carbon Dating Technolgy ( which can age any rock/materils) : so American team test rock age and chose Ethopia and found 3.2 M years old APE Fossile
