  + **Retention of these languages with time:** Lack of centralizing tendencies in India that would steam-roll these languages into fewer languages. 
We never had a Language Governing Board or a Spelling Board or a ruler banning languages.
  + 
  + asr: where are in CHINA you have great Empires Hun EMpire 250 BC - 200 AD in that time frame, great Unification happened, hence resulted in very few languages
  + where are in India, thre are so many small states . In BC 200 there was a ['Maurya' Empire of Asoka for 200 years: 326 BCE - 180 BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire), Asoka was the most famous of it
  + after that there is ['Gupta' Empire : 320CE - 550 CE : Golden age of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_Empire) ( sansrikt was main official language ) .
  + Even at Independence time, [India has 500 Princy States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_princely_states_of_British_India_(alphabetical))  - shows so many scattered little parts.
