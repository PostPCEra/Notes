## Programming Pedagogy

### Patterns
+ **Accumulation**
  - Accumulation into  either a variable ( calculate Sum of a List numbers )  or in a List ( append to List in each iteration )
```
def find_sum(lst):
  sum = 0
  for x in lst:
     sum = sum + x
   return sum
    
    
 def find_squares(lst):
 sq_lst = []
 for x in lst:
     sq_lst.append( x * x )   
 return sq_lst   
     
     
 ```
 
+ **Keep One**
  - ex. find the largest number in a List
```
def find_large(lst):
  large = lst[0]
  for x in lst:
     if x > large:
        large = x 
  return large
```
+ **Filter ( Keep Some )**
  - return a List whose elements are greater than avarge of List numbers.
  - this is ACCUMULATION,  Formula , Filter as last steps

+ ** Driver and Core**
  - Driver do the house keeping , a) chunk out appropriate INPUT to send to CORE b) do call Core Function and perform 'Accumulation or Keep ONE ' operation 
  
+ ** At higher level, many porgramming tasks are one of **  a) Map  b) Reduce or c) Filter

### Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years - Peter Norvig (google)
Pter Norvig quoting the following from the book [Cognition in Practice:](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521357349)

+ **the most effective learning requires** 
  - a well-defined task with an appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual, 
  - informative feedback, and 
  - opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors.


### Programmer Competency Matrix
+ [author sates Level 0/1 to 3](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/)
  -  we (asr) may form a similar Levels for  Learners such as
  - Level 0 :
  - Level 1 : can understand variables, IF statements ,  loops such as FOR .  But can not Debug a problem in the code
  - Level 2 : can debug code, but can not decompose the problem, can not identify Patterns , can not Apply patterns
  - Level 3 : can Identify patterns, can learn from error correction feedback

## PyTest sample for Gitu program
PyTest parameter passing takes only Strings and Numbers, so passed LIST as String and re-constructed as LIST and passed to driver()

[Parametrizing fixtures and test functions](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html)

### Pytest code
```
from max_span import driver

import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected,desc", [
        ( '[ 4]'  , 1, "1: Just one element"),
        ( '[4, 2]' , 1, "2: two distinct elements "),
        ( '[4, 4]' , 2, "3: two dup elements"),
        ( '[4, 3, 4]' , 3, "4: three elements"),
        ( '[ 4, 5, 1, 3, 8,8,2,6]' , 2, "5: two elements 8,8"),
        ( '[ 4, 5, 1, 3, 4,8,7,6]' , 5, "6: five elements 4..4"),
        ( '[ 4, 5, 1, 3, 4,8,5,6]' , 6, "7: six elements 5..5 over taking span 5 of 4..4"),
])

def test_eval(test_input, expected, desc):
      # PyTest parameter passing takes only Strings and Numbers, 
       # so passed LIST as String and re-constructed as LIST and passed to driver()

        lst = [int(x) for x in test_input[1:-1].split(',') ]
        assert driver(lst) == expected , desc


```

### main program code
```
def max_span(lis):
    l = len(lis)
    while (l > 0):
        l = l - 1
        if (lis[0] == lis[l]):
            return l + 1
        
def driver(lis):
    max1 = 0
    for x in xrange(0,len(lis)-1): 
        m2 = max_span(lis[x:])
        if m2 > max1: 
            max1 = m2
    return max1

# main call 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    lis = [ 4, 5, 6, 3, 4,4,5,6]
    mlen = driver(lis)
    print(mlen)

# Testing : run this command from Terminal
# pytest -v test_max_span.py
```
