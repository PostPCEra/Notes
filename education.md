#### Practice & Delibarate practice
+ **Practice** is the act of rehearsing a behavior over and over, or engaging in an activity again and again, for the purpose of improving or mastering it, as in the phrase "practice makes perfect". Sports teams practice to prepare for actual games. Playing a musical instrument well takes a lot of practice.
+ Psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, [a pioneer in researching deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method))

> **People believe** that because expert performance is qualitatively different from a normal performance the expert performer must be **endowed with characteristics** qualitatively different from those of normal adults. 

> we argue that the **differences between expert performers and normal** adults reflect **a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve** performance **in a specific domain**.[3]

> An expert **breaks down the skills** that are required to be expert and focuses on improving those skill **chunks** during practice or day-to-day activities, often paired with **immediate coaching feedback**. Another important feature of deliberate practice lies in continually **practicing a skill at more challenging levels** with the intention of mastering it.

#### What is Deliberate Practice?
+ During a 2012 talk, **programmer and author Kathy Sierra** explained deliberate practice with a very simple and elegant answer. Kathy is [Author of Head First Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra). Head First Java in 2003, **takes an unorthodox, visually intensive** approach to the **process of teaching programming.** 

> Deliberate practice is when you **work on a skill that requires 1 to 3 practice sessions to master**. If it **takes longer than that**, then you are working on something **that is too complex**.

> Once you master this tiny behavior, you can move on to **practicing the next small task** that will take 1 to 3 sessions to master. **Repeat this process for 10,000 hours. That is deliberate practice**.

### 3 Questions for More Deliberate Practice
+ From what I can tell, the experts who embrace the idea of deliberate practice continually ask themselves three questions…

> **1. Do I understand the fundamentals?** No matter how advanced they become, experts never lose sight of the fundamentals. In many ways, they are advanced for that very reason: they understand the fundamentals better than anyone else.

> **2. Am I working on the next step?** There are a lot of smart people waste time working on skills that don't build upon each other. Experts **build knowledge and skills that are cumulative.**

> **3. What am I missing?** Experts are constantly asking themselves, “What am I missing? What new information is out there? What can I learn? How can I grow?

#### Learning by Teaching : [German: Lernen durch Lehren, short LdL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching){:target="_blank"}  

> learning by teaching (German: Lernen durch Lehren, short LdL) designates currently the method by Jean-Pol Martin that allows pupils and students to prepare and to teach lessons, or parts of lessons.
> Students not only convey a certain content, but also choose their own methods and didactic approaches in teaching classmates that subject

> You can’t just stand there and lecture. You need to change your facial expression and be animated, share some jokes, tailor your message to your audience, and be personable. Even if you’re not a teacher, being able to do this will help you anytime you need to make a presentation or address a group of people.

> Successful, fast-growing businesses are being built in education outside of teaching: Clever, Remind, TeachersPayTeachers, and ClassDojo are four I admire. All four build tools, and in 2015, if you want an education business that can grow quickly, build a tool that thousands of teachers could find useful.  
> If you want to teach, prepare for a slog. Teaching online is in an R&D phase: we don’t know how to teach online in an internet-native way, and we definitely don’t know how to monetize online teaching in an internet-native way. More bluntly: though teaching the world sounds great, no one’s figured out how to do it.

> By the end of the summer, the **stronger students were those who had made more mistakes**: they’d tried more things, compiled more bad code, hit more runtime errors, and confused the REPL more soundly. Their banging produced better mental models, so they could anticipate what code would do when run. **When students experimented in logical ways, they developed confidence in solving problems with code.**

> Being an **efficient learner** is at least as important as being an **efficient coder**.
> When you’re a developer, your job requires you to learn every single day. You constantly encounter new code bases and new technical challenges at work.
> The tech world changes fast, and it can feel like a full-time job just keeping up with the latest tools, languages and frameworks.
> Long story short: learning is hard. Yet, **we need to be able to learn quickly and effectively to thrive**.

#### Growth stages of a Programmer 
- stage 1: Complex Solution to Simple Problem
- stage 2: Complex Solution to Complex Problem
- stage 3: Simple Solution to Complex Problem  

after so many years of programming, I may be at 2.2 , with Recent Python lang expertise I amy be at 2.4 now .  
when hiring somebody, you need to explain This CONCEPT to them, ask them to Rate themselves.  

> The Utimate goal of any programmer is to PROVIDE SOLUTIONS, if he/she can do SS to CP that is **Programmer Nirvana**  
> In order to get Simple Solutions, one should aware of "what is out there" ( what other people have built all over the world in Open Source communities (github), what are the some of Best of Bread solutions in a given domain ( say Rails , Djanago, user Auth solutions etc)
